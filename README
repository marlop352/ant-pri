Wumpus World Simulator v2.3

This version of the wumpus-world simulator adds an image to each percept.  Below is a
description of the files involved.  See comments in the files for
details.  Loading wumpus2.pl will load the other files.


wumpus2.pl       New wumpus-world simulator.  Contains the random
                 wumpus-world generator, and the procedure
                 evaluate_agent(Trials,Score,Time) which calls an
                 externally-defined agent.  Note that the procedure
                 intialize(W,P) now takes two arguments, in case you
                 want to use it for testing.  Also included is a
                 wumpus world displayer (display_world).

image.pl         Code for generating a binary image of the square faced
                 by the agent.  The image contains bitmaps of the wumpus,
                 pit and/or gold.
